# No. of hours spent :  
Around 55 hrs.

# How i tested my code : 
I have tested my code by passing multiple maps through the adventure.py file to test all the functionalities of every verb. and each extension to make it work properly without any errors.

# bugs or issues i could not resolve : 
None.

# an example of a difficult issue or bug and how you resolved :
I have faced some major issues while adding the extensions to the base functionality of text adventure game. I had to go through the concepts, rerer to some webpages to get an idea of where it went wrong, and I was able to resole those errors.

# a list of the three extensions youâ€™ve chosen to implement, with appropriate detail on them for the CAs to evaluate them (i.e., what are the new verbs/features, how do you exercise them, where are they in the map)
1. Directions become Verbs : If the user simply types 'east' instead of 'go east', it should call the go function and let the user move into that direction if an exit is available. It works for all directions including the unusual exits like 'nw' which refers to 'northwest' in any context of the game..

2. Drop verb : The drop verb is the opposite of get: take something from your inventory and put it down in the room. Just as get only lets you get items that are in the room, drop should only let you drop items that you already have. This verb takes the items from the inventory and drops it whenever you use the drop verb
